		<img class="picture2" src="webbilder/me1header.jpg" width=260 height=222 alt="First Mass Effect game cover" />
		<p>The player takes on the role of Commander Shepard onboard the SSV Normandy. A routine mission to recover a Prothean beacon on Eden Prime goes awry when the Commander is attacked by geth forces led by a rogue turian Spectre named Saren Arterius, who are also after the beacon. When the Commander locates the beacon it activates, imparting strange visions of synthetics slaughtering organics in Shepard's mind before becoming inactive. It turns out that Saren is trying to find the Conduit, a mysterious device that will lead to the return of the Reapers, an ancient machine race believed to be behind the Protheans' demise. Shepard becomes the first human Spectre and is given command of the Normandy with orders to hunt down Saren. Now it is no longer just about bringing one man to justice, but also to save a galaxy from extinction.

		<h3>History of the game:</h3>
		<img class="picture2" src="webbilder/massrelay.jpg" width=384 height=216 alt="A Mass Relay" />
		<p>Mass Effect is set in the year 2183. Thirty-five years earlier, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct species called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring species are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of "Citadel space".

		<p>The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the "First Contact War" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays which was a practice considered unsafe by Citadel races, as it resulted in the Rachni Wars. The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The Citadel Council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council.
