    <h2>Final Fantasy X General Information</h2>
Final Fantasy X (ファイナルファンタジーX Fainaru Fantajī Ten?) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Soft (now Square Enix) as the tenth entry in the Final Fantasy series. Originally released in 2001 for Sony's PlayStation 2, the game was re-released as a high-definition port for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita on March 18, 2014, under the name Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster.[5][6][7] It was also re-released for the PlayStation 4 in May 2015.[4] The game marks the Final Fantasy series transition from entirely pre-rendered backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas, and is also the first in the series to feature voice acting. Final Fantasy X replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the "Conditional Turn-Based Battle" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the "Sphere Grid".

Set in the fantasy world of Spira, the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a blitzball star who finds himself in Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the summoner Yuna on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.

Development of Final Fantasy X began in 1999, with a budget of more than US$32.3 million and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. Final Fantasy X was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 6.6 million units worldwide. On March 3, 2003, it was followed by Final Fantasy X-2, making it the first Final Fantasy game to have a direct game sequel.

<article id="spillmekanik" alt="Final Fantasy X gameplay"><h2>Gameplay</h2>
Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.[8]

The gameplay of Final Fantasy X differs from that of previous Final Fantasy games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In Final Fantasy X, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X features numerous minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport "blitzball".[9]

<section alt="Final Fantasy X Battlesystem"><h3>Battlesystems</h3>
Final Fantasy X introduces the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system in place of the series' traditional Active Time Battle system first used in Final Fantasy IV. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. "Limit Breaks", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in Final Fantasy X as "Overdrives". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness.[10] While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.[11]

Final Fantasy X introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the "Aeons" of Final Fantasy X arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests.[10]

<section id="sphere" alt="Final Fantasy X sphere grid"><h3>Sphere Grid</h3>    
Sphere Grid[rediger | rediger kilde]
Som tidligere spill i serien, kan spilleren utvikle og forbedre figurene sine ved å slå fiender og finne gjenstander. Det tradisjonelle «erfaringspoeng»-systemet ble erstattet med et nytt system kalt «Sphere Grid». I stedet for det tidligere systemet brukt i Final Fantasy-spill som gir figurene en forhåndsbestemt oppgradering av sine egenskaper når de har samlet nok erfaringspoeng, gir Sphere Grid muligheten for spilleren selv å velge oppgraderinger. Etter hver kamp får figurene som deltok i kampen ability points (AP). Når de har samlet nok kan spilleren flytte en markør rundt på et nettverk bygd opp av noder som er forbundet med hverandre. Spilleren kan da bruke sfærer, som fås tak i på flere måter i løpet av spillet, på disse nodene for å aktivere dem. Dette oppgraderer figuren hvis markør spilleren flytter på.[3]

Sphere Grid gir også spilleren mulighet til å skreddersy figurenes ferdigheter i motsetning til at spillet gir dem visse roller. For eksempel kan magikeren Yuna gjøres til en kriger og sverdmesteren Auron til en som leger de andre figurene. Den internasjonale- og PAL-versjonen har en valgfri ekspertversjon av nodenettverket som plasserer markørene til alle figurene midt i nettet; spilleren kan derfor velge hvilken rolle de skal ha fra begynnelsen av spillet. En ulempe med dette nettverket er at det har færre noder enn det vanlige slik at figurene ikke kan gjøres like sterke.[4]

    <section alt="Final Fantasy X setting and characters"><h3>Setting and characters</h3>
Final Fantasy X is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language.[14][15] The Guado are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the "unsent", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into "fiends", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game;[16] however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most Final Fantasy games. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous Final Fantasy games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.[17]

There are seven main playable characters in Final Fantasy X, starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira.[14] To do so, he joins Yuna, a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like "Sin".[18] Journeying with them are: Kimahri Ronso, a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood;[19] Wakka, a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin;[20][21] and Lulu, a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka.[18] During the journey, they are joined by Auron, a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior;[22] and Rikku, Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.[14]

<section alt="Final Fantasy X Story"><h3>Story</h3>
The story begins with the main protagonist, Tidus, waiting with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. Tidus narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline.[23] It begins in Tidus's home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned star of the underwater sport blitzball.[24] During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature which Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls "Sin".[25] Sin destroys Zanarkand, taking Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.[14]

Upon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers in the area. Upon asking him where he is from, one of them, Rikku, tells him that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago.[26] After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team.[20] Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin;[18][27] and her guardians, Lulu and Kimahri. Meanwhile, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the upcoming blitzball tournament to find a way back home.[18][28][29] The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its "offspring"—fiends called Sinspawn.[30] After the tournament, they are joined by Auron, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna's guardian.[31] He reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord Braska; Tidus's father, Jecht; and himself made the same pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years ago.[22] Tidus thought his father had died at sea ten years earlier.[32] Following another attack from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later revealed to be Yuna's cousin.[33]

When the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado, Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira's sorrow.[34] At Macalania Temple, the group sees a message from Seymour's father Jyscal, who declares he was killed by his son, who now aims to destroy Spira.[35] The group reunites with Yuna to engage Seymour in battle, killing him;[36] soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna from the others.[37] While searching for her on Bikanel Island, the homeland of the Al Bhed where they had surfaced,[37] Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive.[38][39] The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour.[40][41] They crash the wedding and escape with Yuna.[42] The group is captured at the Bevelle temple, and are ordered to stand trial.[43] After escaping from their sentence, the group heads towards the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.[23][27][44]

On the way there, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people.[45] Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated.[46] Zanarkand's survivors became "fayth" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira.[46][47] One thousand years after its creation, the fayth have become exhausted from "dreaming" their Zanarkand, but are unable to stop due to Sin's influence.[45][48]

Once they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since[49]—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue.[50] Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn.[51] Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon.[52] After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth.[48] This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour and Jecht's imprisoned spirits.[53][54] With Sin's hosts defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon.[55] Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane, having died years ago after confronting Yunalesca.[56][57] Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning.[58] Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin.[59] In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.
